- Put your own's dataset in dataset folder.
- Run algorithm. (We use jupyter notebook so we must seperate into 3 differents file)
- Result of compression/decompression will store in compress/decompress folder.
- Compression ratio will store in result folder.
- Because our dataset is too large (64MB),so we just save the finally result.
