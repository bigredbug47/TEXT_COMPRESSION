Early life and career

Fong was a child actress at ATV in the 1980s. Actor Bowie Wu is her godfather. She got famous from her role, Nezha, in the 1986 TV series The Boy Fighter from Heaven, and is nicknamed after the role. After she graduated from the University of Hawaii with a bachelor's degree in Business Administration, she obtained the qualification of a building engineer and worked as secretary of Cheung Yan-lung, a powerful rural leader.
District councillor

She joined the Liberal Party in 2004 and served as the chairman of the New Territories East Branch until 2010 when she quit the Liberals. She was appointed to the Sai Kung District Council in 2008 and elected to the Council through the new Wan Po constituency in the 2011 election with high votes.

She has been outspoken against the government's plan of the extension of the Tseung Kwan O landfill which is located in her constituency of Wan Po North. She also launched a 35-hour fast outside the Legislative Council building to protest against the landfill extensions in 2013.[1]

Fong was also involved in an assault case against Elizabeth Quat, a Legislative Councillor of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB), when Fong and a group of protestors confronted Quat in a protest against the extension of the Tseung Kwan O landfill.[2] She was later found not guilty of the charge on 22 February 2016.[3]

In 2015 election, she was re-elected through the new Wan Po North constituency which was split from her original constituency after a boundary review.
Bids for Legislative Council

She ran for the 2012 Legislative Council election in New Territories East, receiving 24,594 votes, about 4,000 votes short for claiming a seat.

She announced to run for the 2016 New Territories East by-election, a seat left vacant by Ronny Tong who resigned in the light of the 2015 Hong Kong electoral reform.[4] She finished fourth place in the election by receiving 33,424 votes, around 8,000 more than the 2012 election.[5]
